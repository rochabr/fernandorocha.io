Hi! :)
<br>
I fell in love with the Mac when my parents bought a Performa back in the early 90â€™s and have been hacking ever since. I have worked for software companies active in Packaging, Marketing and Mobile. Currently I live in London, where I help connect the world as iOS engineer at Facebook. When off duty, I enjoy running and entertaining my two children.
