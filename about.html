I fell in love with mobile development when I met J2ME back in 2006 and I haven't left it ever since. J2ME went away, but Android and iOS came along to replace it perfectly. Currently I live in Houston, where I get my hands dirty as an mobile engineer at Schlumberger. At my free time, I enjoy video games(dark souls is my all time favorite) and taking pictures of my dog.

I'm married, born in Rio de Janeiro and currently overweight.
