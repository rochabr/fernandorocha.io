On January 3rd I got a call from my current boss, I was still living in the wonderful land of Rio de Janeiro and I was eager to get out of there as soon as possible so, when he called me to discuss an opportunity in the US, I was really excited. They needed someone that wes already working in the company for a while and had a strong mobile development background(check and check). We went through his ideas, I gave my two cents and somehere, in the middle of our conversation, I asked about if we were going to use ObjC and Java for iOS and Android.

He answered "No, we are using Xamarin". And he explained to me that it was a cross platform mobile development tool. My first thought was to ask myself what the hell was that because, to be honest, I've tried many cross development tools for mobile development before and they were all not worth the cost or the time. Titanium, Phone Gap, Corona; they all worked, but the results were not good.

The idea of cross platform development is great, in my opinion. Develop for all platforms, coding faster and keeping the quality of your work. Easier said than done. So, I was sad at first, because I was excited to show off my ObjC skills and teach the new team how cool it is. But it was just a minor bump in the way of my hapiness.

Fast forward 6 months and I'm in the US, I have a desk and a MacBook Pro 15", top of the line. Not too shabby. I also have Xamarin Studio installed and I'm willing to learn what this tool is all about. I've read some good reviews and some really bad ones. So, my first thought was: it is not that great, but it has value. 9 months later, I still keep the same thought.

Little pro/con list:

Cons

-	Xamarin is expensive. Licenses, training, certification, events. They are all way out of you regular developer price range.
-	The "Write once, run anywhere" motto is a myth, unless you are looking at a very simple app. 
-	The development process is slow compared to objC(iOS) and Java(Android). Building screens and positioning components is not that easy, specially when you have complicated UI elements.
-	The learning curve is somethin to think about. The idea  of "Am I doing the right thing?" is constant and disturbing.
-	The big guys aren't using it. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Evernote, Booking: they are going with objC and Android. So don't expect to see cool frameworks like [Pop][pop-url] on Xamarin, unless you build them yourself or wait for someone to do it for you.
-	Help online is scarce and it always comes from the same guys, who are very good.

Pros

-	Xamarin works. It takes time, it is not always pretty, but it works. We are able to deliver quality products in the end.
-	C# is a powerful and easy language.
-	Xamarin university is REALLY good. I can't say this enough. It's probably one of the best online classes I've ever seen in my life.
-	Xamarin is perfect for quick mockups and tiny MVPs, where you are not trying to make things very pretty, but trying to give an idea of how your app you behave in Android and iOS.
