It's funny.

I've been a developer my whole life(since I was 18, professionaly) and I've always tought of myself as a good one. I've never had any issues solving any challenges that my employers presented. Some were easy, others took a little bit more time, but they were never unsolved. I must say, though, that I had a lot of different jobs. Usually with the same title and responsabilities, but in many different companies.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
