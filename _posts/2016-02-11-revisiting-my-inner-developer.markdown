It's funny.

I've been a developer my whole life(since I was 18, professionaly) and I've always tought of myself as a good one. I've never had any issues solving any challenges that my employers presented. Some were easy, others took a little bit more time, but they were never unsolved. I must say, though, that I had a lot of different jobs. Usually with the same title and responsabilities, but in many different companies. I have spoken in conferences, landed great jobs and participated in some life changing projects throughout my career.

The thing is, in 2013 I had my first big failure as a developer. I was interviewed for a job opening in Facebook(a dream, right?). And I thought I had it. Yes, I was a silly goose but, what the hell, right? I had nailed every single interview I've ever been in. Technical and non-technical. Well, not that one. I failed that one HARD! And, you know what? I didn't take it easy. I felt like the worst piece of crap and I've developed something called Imposter Syndrome, although, at the time, it didn't have a name. Not to me anyways.

Here is the deal: I started to think that I was an imposter, a phony, a person who was full of it. Everything that I've accomplished in my life was a lie. My jobs, promotions, compliments that I have received. EVERYTHING! Even now, 3 years later, after receiving 3 incredible feedbacks from my managers and peers, I still think that I'm deceiving them.

I came upon this term, Imposter Syndrome, just a few weeks ago, in a [youtube video][bluesoft-talk] from a [channel][bluesoft-channel] I follow closely. It is portuguese only(sorry). And it was eye opening to me. "I'm not alone", I thought. And it was pretty clear to me that my lack of confidence in my skills brought me to that position. I won't feel confortable and confident if I had to do a technical interview. And this is something that needs fixing ASAP.

Million dollars question: How to change that?

Well, you are going to find a lot of solutions online, which might be right or wrong, as I haven't tried them. There is a great post by [David Walsh][david-imposter] that was very helpful and made me feel better about myself. He is clearly more succesful than I am and he still suffers from this. I'm REALLY not alone on this one. I decided, though, to ask myself what brouht me into this... The facebook failure was not the starting point, it was the last drop. I was feeling like an imposter way before that, but it wasn't bothering me. I failed the facebook interview for multiple reasons:

1 - I forgot the basics. Peterson, Dijkstra, Knuth let my mind as soon as I gaduated and started working in real software.
2 - I lean to much on the intellisense feature that comes along with  99% of the IDEs.
3 - Stackoverflow made me a little bit more stupid everytime I was in a hurry to understand what was going on in that piece of borrowed code.
